1. Fix parser rules in CommadGrammar.g4 - ask Uzair 

2. Find out how to generate lexer.py, listener.py, and parser.py from ANTLR

3. Create parser.py which deals with output from parser

4. Create command.py which implements command, pipe, seq and call from parser rules

5. Finish Application Factory 

6. Putting application_factory.py, parser.py, and command.py together should mark the shell work
Flags will not work yet

7. Add custom exceptions? such as ApplicationError, ArgumentError, ParsingError to catch errors in main_shell.py
This allows the shell to skip the current cmdline if an error occurs and start the REPL again

8. Find out a way to implement flags. Will the parser handle this?
Or will the parser just separate the commands and args. Then manually clean the args to separate flags and actual args
