- should use `from typing import List` in e.g. def execute(self, args: List[str], stdin: str) -> str, instead of `list`
- consider raising errors in format f"{self.name}: {directory_path}: No such file or directory."
  ApplicationError should take (name, and arguments then)
- use `mock` for testing?
- Update the requirement.txt (remember about antlr version, antlr4-python3-runtime==4.13.1)
- Where does the name AbstractShellFeature in expressions.py come from?
- In converter.py, rename functions to use the underscore_notation

Applications
- Ls
  - add more error handling, e.g. permission error ?


Tests
- test_expressions.py
  - Go through all the tests once again, checking if they are representative of real commands
