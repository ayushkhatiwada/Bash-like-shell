1. Difference between args and input:
def exec(self, input: list[str], out: deque[str], args: list[str]) -> None:

args means command line arguments
Command line arguments are given to the application that is being run, before it is run. 
e.g. "grep hello file.txt" -  The args here are hello and file.txt

Input refers to data that is provided to a script or program during its execution.
This can be interactively entered by the user or read from a file or another command's output.

However if you do 
"cat file.txt | grep hello"
cat prints the contents of file.txt to stdout, the pipe then feeds file.txt to the stdin of grep
file.txt is the input of grep


2. Note from Sergey you can use AI to generat the command fucntions
How you implement the commands aren't important
What is important is design, code quality, readability, and integration 


3. USE decorator design pattern for unsafe application e.g. _ls, _grep
Discover how unsafe applications work and implement them
