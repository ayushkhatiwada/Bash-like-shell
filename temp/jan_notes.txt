- should use `from typing import List` in e.g. def execute(self, args: List[str], stdin: str) -> str, instead of `list`
- consider raising errors in format f"{self.name}: {directory_path}: No such file or directory."
  ApplicationError should take (name, and arguments then)
- use `mock` for testing?
- Update the requirement.txt (remember about antlr version, antlr4-python3-runtime==4.13.1)
- Where does the name AbstractShellFeature in expressions.py come from?
- In converter.py, rename functions to use the underscore_notation
- Make Application return a List[] instead of modifying a Deque[] (Requires a lot of rewriting, so probably not worth it)
- What is the accept method in expressions.py class Argument
- NON_KEYWORD useless in antlr grammar
- Output lines shouldn't have '\n'  at the end, this should be added in the shell.py
- converter.py: change AssertionErrors to something more specific

Applications
- Ls
  - add more error handling, e.g. permission error ?


Tests
- test_expressions.py
  - Go through all the tests once again, checking if they are representative of real commands
- Don't have any statements outside methods in test files: e.g. in test_cd use self.cd_app in setUp
